# Underwater-Image-Enhancment-techniques using muti-fusion techniques
The primary aim of this project is to enhance underwater images to make them suitable for a range of practical applications, such as entertainment, underwater robotics, surveillance for naval operations, and object detection. Underwater images often suffer from significant challenges, including poor color accuracy, haziness, and low visibility, which hinder their usability.
